performance-as3
===============

## Introduction
This is an experimental library for ActionScript 3 geared towards high-performance math, and is losely modeled on the Intel Performance Primitives library.

Please note that this project is in pre-alpha, and should not be used in production. Its purpose is to investigate the feasibility and usefulness of such a library, and gauge the community's interest.

This library is intended to be used in tandem with the (reintroduced) domainMemory opcodes in the upcoming runtime release.

Depending on platform, function and number of elements, a speed-up of 2-10x can be achieved as compared to native Flash Player math with Vector.<Number>.
